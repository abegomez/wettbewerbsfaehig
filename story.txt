Once upon a time in the small village of Munich, a boy dreamed of becoming a pilot.
He went to his local Flughafen in his trusty BMW to sign up for lessons when he ran into Rammstein.
They talked for hours about their love of mathematics and the work of Karl Firedrich Guass.
While they talked they enjoyed a schloss.
The boy was deeply taken by a young lady and he told her, "I like your Lederhose..."
When a large Brot came flying from an unknown location and smacked him in the side of the head with a wet slap.
He yelled out "Get me another Bratwurst!" to the nearest server in the biergarten.
